About: Daniel Morgan
 
I work and play at [Tumult](http://tumult.com) and my core focus is supporting users creating HTML5 animations with Tumult Hype. I've worked with teams at Amazon Game Studios, Reuters, Al Jazeera, Foursquare & more to help create performant prototypes, infographics, and web content. I problem-solve for the web.

I'm currently starting up an internet-infused creative space in New York's Catskill Mountains with my partner, Willa Koerner. Learn all about it here: [thestrange.foundation](https://thestrange.foundation).

I occasionally take on side projects to keep the mental juices flowing, ranging from cryptocurrency analysis to web & email programming to general web tech consulting. Projects like Kickstarter's year in review:

I also sometimes [write about Bitcoin](https://rememberi.es/index.php?/essays/2017/12/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline/), and you can find me [on Medium here](https://medium.com/@danielmorgan).
